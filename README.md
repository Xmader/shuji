## Getting started

Install the `shuji` command line utility globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
Elevated privileges might be needed via `sudo`, depending on the platform. In most cases just:

```sh
npm install --global shuji
```

Please note that this tool requires the minimum [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
version to be `4.2.0`, which is the Long Term Support (LTS) version.

## Command line options

The output of `shuji --help` pretty much covers all the options:

```sh
shuji - Reverse engineering JavaScript and CSS sources from sourcemaps
Usage: shuji [options] <file|directory>

  -h, --help               Help and usage instructions
  -V, --version            Version number
  -v, --verbose            Verbose output, will print which file is currently being processed
  -o, --output-dir String  Output directory - default: .
  -M, --match String       Regular expression for matching and filtering files - default: \.map$
  -r, --recursive          Recursively search matching files

Version 0.3.0
```

## Testing

Test files are generated with [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) and
[`sass`](http://sass-lang.com)
by using files from the [stretchy](https://github.com/LeaVerou/stretchy) project,
with the following commands:

```sh
uglifyjs stretchy.js --compress --mangle \
 -o stretchy.min.js --source-map stretchy.min.js.map

uglifyjs stretchy.js --compress --mangle \
 -o stretchy.min.js --source-map stretchy-with-sources.min.js.map \
 --source-map-include-sources

sass stretchy.scss:stretchy.css

sass stretchy.scss:stretchy.css --sourcemap=inline
```

Unit tests are written with [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape) and can be executed with `npm test`.
Code coverage is inspected with [`nyc`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and
can be executed with `npm run coverage` after running `npm test`.
Please make sure it is over 90% at all times.
